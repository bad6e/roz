## Do you have employees who consistently use acronyms on Slack?

### If so, do you get confused at sentences like these below?

```
1. What was the CPC on the new GA campaign?

2. Did this campaign generate anymore UV?

3. Did they not read our TOS - they should know we are a B2B and not a B2C - LOLZ?
```

Yes it is annoying - constantly looking up the meaning of things. But now there is Roz.
